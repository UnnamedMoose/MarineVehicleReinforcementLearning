## Overview

Examples of how to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the context of marine vehicle control.

# Current version

much better!

# Past version 1 - simple AUV dynamics and control

`tag_00_Dec2023_simpleControlTurbulence` - this contains an image of the repository before first major refactoring. This version of the code may be used to reproduce the results presented in [this conference paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Artur-Lidtke/publication/369321603_Combining_deep_reinforcement_learning_and_computational_fluid_dynamics_for_efficient_navigation_in_turbulent_flows/links/64a2695e8de7ed28ba6fe59c/Combining-deep-reinforcement-learning-and-computational-fluid-dynamics-for-efficient-navigation-in-turbulent-flows.pdf). This is no longer maintained but should still work and provide a useful reference. This version of the code can be cited with:
